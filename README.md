## Description
Create a microservice-based application using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud that provides movie recommendations to users based on their preferences. The application should have the following microservices:
Microservices.
- User microservice - responsible for managing user profiles and preferences
- Movie microservice - responsible for managing the movie catalog
- Recommendation microservice - responsible for generating movie recommendations for users
- Authentication microservice - responsible for authenticating users and generating access tokens
- Rating microservice - responsible for storing and retrieving user ratings for movies
The recommendation microservice should generate recommendations based on user ratings and preferences. You can use any recommendation algorithm of your choice to implement this microservice.
Each microservice should have its own database and should communicate with other microservices via REST APIs. The authentication microservice should use JWT tokens to secure the APIs.
You are also required to develop a front-end application that will allow users to interact with the microservices. The front-end should be developed using Angular or React, and should have the following features:.

#### Features:

- User registration and login
- Movie browsing and searching
- Movie rating and review
- Movie recommendation

## Timeline:
- Day 1:
o Set up the project structure using Spring Initializr and create the microservices
using Spring Boot
o Set up the front-end project using Angular
- Day 2:
o Implement user registration and login functionality in the front-end
o Implement basic CRUD operations for the user microservice
- Day 3:
o Implement the REST APIs for the user microservice
o Implement basic CRUD operations for the movie microservice
- Day 4:
o Implement the REST APIs for the movie microservice
o Implement movie browsing and searching functionality in the front-end
- Day 5:
o Implement movie rating and review functionality in the front-end
o Implement the recommendation algorithm in the recommendation microservice
- Day 6:
o Integrate the recommendation microservice with the other microservices
o Implement movie recommendation functionality in the front-end
- Day 7:
o Test and debug the application
o Final testing and debugging
o Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
and test again

#### Crit√®res
-Completeness (5 points): Did both of you complete all the required features and
functionalities for each microservice? Were all endpoints and functions implemented
and working correctly?
Implement all microservices in demand
 -Quality of code (5 points): Did both of you write clean, well-organized code that
follows best practices and is easy to read and maintain? Was the code reviewed and
tested to ensure its correctness and robustness?
- User Experience (5 points): Was the user interface intuitive and easy to use? Did the
application provide sufficient feedback and guidance to users? Were error messages
clear and helpful?
- Creativity and Innovation (2 points): Did either of you come up with unique or clever
solutions to any of the challenges faced during development?
