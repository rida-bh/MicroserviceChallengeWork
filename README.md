Challenge requirement
Subject:
Building a Movie Recommendation System using Microservices
Specification:
Create a microservice-based application using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud that provides movie recommendations to users based on their preferences. The application should have the following microservices:
Microservices
➢ User microservice - responsible for managing user profiles and preferences
➢ Movie microservice - responsible for managing the movie catalog
➢ Recommendation microservice - responsible for generating movie recommendations for users
➢ Authentication microservice - responsible for authenticating users and generating access tokens
➢ Rating microservice - responsible for storing and retrieving user ratings for movies
The recommendation microservice should generate recommendations based on user ratings and preferences. You can use any recommendation algorithm of your choice to implement this microservice.
Each microservice should have its own database and should communicate with other microservices via REST APIs. The authentication microservice should use JWT tokens to secure the APIs.
You are also required to develop a front-end application that will allow users to interact with the microservices. The front-end should be developed using Angular or React, and should have the following features:
o User registration and login
o Movie browsing and searching
o Movie rating and review
o Movie recommendation
The front-end should consume the REST APIs provided by the microservices.
Timeline:
✓ Day 1:
o Set up the project structure using Spring Initializr and create the microservices
using Spring Boot
o Set up the front-end project using Angular
✓ Day 2:
o Implement user registration and login functionality in the front-end
o Implement basic CRUD operations for the user microservice
✓ Day 3:
o Implement the REST APIs for the user microservice
o Implement basic CRUD operations for the movie microservice
✓ Day 4:
o Implement the REST APIs for the movie microservice
o Implement movie browsing and searching functionality in the front-end
✓ Day 5:
o Implement movie rating and review functionality in the front-end
o Implement the recommendation algorithm in the recommendation microservice
✓ Day 6:
o Integrate the recommendation microservice with the other microservices
o Implement movie recommendation functionality in the front-end
✓ Day 7:
o Test and debug the application
o Final testing and debugging
o Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
and test again
